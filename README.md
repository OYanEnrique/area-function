# 📏 Area Calculator

A simple command-line tool to calculate the area of a rectangular plot of land based on user-provided width and length.

This script serves as a basic example of using functions in Python to encapsulate a specific piece of logic.

## Features

* **User Input**: Prompts the user for the width and length of the plot.
* **Function-Based Calculation**: Encapsulates the area calculation (`width * length`) inside a dedicated `area()` function.
* **Formatted Output**: Displays the final result in a clear, readable sentence.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `area.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python area.py
    ```
4.  The program will prompt you to enter the width and the length.
5.  It will then immediately print the calculated area.

### Example Session

```sh
> python area.py
------Area calculator------
Enter the width:
10
Enter the length:
25
The area of ​​a plot of land is 10.0 x 25.0 is 250.0m².
```
